		<p>
			Uses <a href="http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js/">D3</a> to create a force directed graph from 
			character co-occurrence in <a href="http://www.lilliputpress.ie/book/144232506/donal_ryan-the_spinning_heart.html">
			The Spinning Heart</a>. This graph does not suggest that the book can be understood or analysed in any meaningful 
			way through character co-occurrence, rather the book was used simply as a dataset. No criticism or analysis or comment 
			of any sort on the book should be imputed from this graph. In other words; it's just a bit of, erm, fun.
